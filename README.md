No more terminal! Merging branches now in vscode.  

# Road Map

My vision is to create the merge resolver we all want, a 3 screen just click and fix merger.  
Coming soon to your VScode.

# Installation

First, you will need to [install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  
Once you have vscode installed access the marketplace and install "Git Merger" extension.

# Commands
The extension commands that can be accessed from the command pallet (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P):

* ```GitMerger: Merge From``` - Merge branch into working branch (write ```mf``` or ```gmf``` for short).
